NSO boasts Water-Only DIFFS Technology for Helidecks

Fire protection includes protection for our planet : Environmentally Friendly, Passive, and Class Certified

</p>

											<h3>Northsea Offshore (NSO) is proud of its cutting-edge Deck Integrated Fire Fighting System (DIFFS)—a  water-only solution that sets new benchmarks for helideck safety in the offshore industry. As the only Chinese company to hold class certification for this state-of-the-art system, NSO is leading the way with technology that not only saves lives and assets but also protects the environment.

Innovative Water-Only Fire Suppression</h3>
											<p>

Traditional firefighting systems for helidecks often rely on chemicals and foams, such as Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), which have been linked to negative environmental impacts including persistent chemical residues and contamination risks. In contrast, NSO’s water-only DIFFS technology uses nothing but water—eliminating harmful chemicals from the equation. This approach offers a greener, more sustainable solution for protecting critical offshore assets.

Advanced Perforated Helideck Design

At the heart of NSO’s DIFFS system is a specially engineered and patented perforated helideck surface. This passive design allows flammable liquids classified as Class B—such as aviation fuels—to pass through the deck perforations. As the fuel disperses, it is “broken” into sufficiently small particulate droplets that are unable to sustain combustion. This innovative method not only counteracts the threat of fuel fires but does so without the activation delays or maintenance issues associated with traditional systems.

Addressing Industry Challenges

Offshore heliport operations demand rapid responses to the dynamic challenges posed by high-energy fuel fires. Conventional active systems often depend on complex chemical agents and foam mixtures that pose long-term ecological hazards. NSO’s water-only approach addresses these challenges head-on:

Environmental Benefits: By eliminating AFFF and chemical suppressants, NSO’s DIFFS system prevents the ecological damage that persistent chemicals can cause, safeguarding marine life and reducing clean-up concerns post-incident.
Enhanced Safety and Reliability: The passive design ensures continuous protection without the need for mechanical activation. The perforated surface effectively disperses fuel, drastically reducing the risk of sustained combustion in critical fire scenarios.
Unparalleled Certification and Global Leadership

NSO’s DIFFS system has earned DNV class certification, marking it as the only such certified water-only fire fighting solution from a Chinese company. This prestigious certification confirms that NSO’s innovative technology not only meets but exceeds international safety standards, providing offshore operators with a reliable, environmentally responsible, and cutting-edge method for helideck fire suppression.
